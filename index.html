                Africa, with its 54 nations, has over 1.4 billion people, making it one of the most populous continents
                in the world. African people have made significant contributions to global culture, science, politics, 
                and art throughout history.

             <h3>Cultural Diversity</h3>

             <p>
                Africa is incredibly diverse, with over 3,000 distinct ethnic groups and more than 2,000 languages spoken. 
                Some of the most well-known groups include the Zulu, Maasai, Yoruba, Hausa, Igbo and Berber, each with its 
                unique traditions, belief systems, and societal structures. African music, dance, and storytelling are central 
                to its cultures, with oral traditions being a primary means of passing down history and wisdom across generations.

             <h3>History and Heritage</h3>

             <p>
                African civilizations have a long and influential history, from the powerful empires of Egypt, Mali, and Great Zimbabwe
                to the sophisticated trade routes across the Sahara. The continent is the birthplace of humanity, as the earliest human 
                fossils have been found in East Africa. Over centuries, Africa faced colonization and the transatlantic slave trade, 
                but it has also been a place of immense resistance, resilience, and liberation struggles.
